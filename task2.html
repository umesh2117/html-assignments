    <b>1.<ins>Div</ins>:</b>
    <p>as a container or a box in which you can put other HTML elements. It's like a grouping or a section on your
        webpage. You use it to organize and structure your content.</p>
    <b>2.<ins>Span</ins>:</b>
    <p> but it's used for smaller, inline elements. While a div is a block-level container, a span is an inline
        container. It's often used when you want to apply styles or manipulate a small piece of text within a larger
        block of text.</p>
    <b>3.<ins>Class</ins>:</b>
    <p>In HTML, you can use the class attribute to give a name to an element. This name can be used to apply styles to
        multiple elements on your page. It's like a label that you can use to group and style elements.</p>
    <b>4.<ins>ID</ins>:</b>
    <p>Similar to class, but the id attribute should be unique on a page. It's like giving a specific identifier to an
        element. You can use it to link to a particular section of your page or to style a specific element.</p>
